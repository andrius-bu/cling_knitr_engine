# VERSION 0.3

## Changelog

- Added an `example` with `gnuplot-iostream`. Plots can be saved, however, they have to be manually included. Compared the dates of `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg` or `.pdf` files in a local dir to the start and end timestamps of code, passed to `cling`, but this is unreliable and is quite limited.
- Slight updates to other examples.


# VERSION 0.2

## Changelog

- Moved the `cling` knitr language engine to a separate file in the `src` folder. This file is sourced from the `.Rmd` files in the `examples` folder.
- Added `cpp` code style. See the `examples` folder.
- Added an `example` of how to load third-party libraries.
